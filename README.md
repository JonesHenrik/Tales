# Tales

Tales is a four-chapter playable story designed to entertain readers through an interactive experience.

# Background

Tales was created as part of challenge two in the Apple Developer Academy. Our team was tasked with crafting an engaging story, and we chose to implement it through the Command Line Interface (CLI). The story revolves around the adventure of climbing buildings in Detroit, offering readers an immersive and interactive narrative experience.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


Developing an interactive story presented challenges in type creation. Type creation allowed us to encapsulate data and behavior into reusable components, promoting code organization, clarity, and maintainability.

Handling edge cases allowed us to improve the user experience, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of our project. We utilized a switch statement to handle the user's possible responses, ensuring that their input was accurately processed and that the program responded appropriately.
